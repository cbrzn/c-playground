# Polywrap in C++

Implementation of C binding from rust polywrap client.

This project has been built using CLion which make use of the `CMakeLists.txt` file to
add dynamic library generated by rust client.

In the `lib` folder lives the headers and dynamic library.

In order to run it, clone this repository and open it in CLion, then run the executable by running the c-playground
script. Note that it must be the project & not the `main.cpp` file
